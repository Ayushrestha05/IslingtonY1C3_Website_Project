          Internet technology is the ability of the Internet to transmit information and data through different servers and systems.
          Internet technology is important in many different industries as it allows people to communicate with each other through means that were not necessarily available.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Internet is essentially a large database where all different types of information can be passed and transmitted.
          It can be passively passed along in the form of non-interactive websites and blogs; it can also be actively passed along in the form of file sharing and document loading.
          Internet technology has led to a wealth of information available to anyone who is able to access the Internet. It has allowed people who were accustomed to textbooks and libraries to learn anything they could want from the comfort of a computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Internet technology is constantly improving and is able to speed up the information highway that it has created.
          With the technologies powering the Internet, speeds are faster, more information is available and different processes are done that were not possible in the past.
          Internet technology has changed, and will continue to change, the way that the world does business and how people interact in daily life.
